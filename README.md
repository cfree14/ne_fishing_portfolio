# New England fishing opportunity portfolios under climate change

This it the GitHub repository for a project seeking to document how climate change has altered "fishing opporunity portfolios" in New England and how fishers have responded to these changes in the past and are likely to respond to changes into the future. This project is a collabortation between Sarah Smith, Olaf Jensen, Victoria Ramenzoni, John Wiedenmann, and Malin Pinsky. This work is funded by a NOAA Coastal and Ocean Climate Applications (COCA) Grant to OJ, VR, JW, MP, and CF.
